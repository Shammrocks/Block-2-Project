Welcome to my password strength checker!

-What my program does:
This is a simple program that requests some basic information 
about its user as well as some password, and then informs them 
of their users password strength.

-How to run your program and any necessary dependencies:
To run my program...

-Clear warnings about its limitations:
My program isn't perfect, and I am sure there are some passwords which
could be poor passwords but that would look great to my program, this
program is more so for general use cases, and less so for some edge cases
if I missed any.

-Ethical considerations and responsible use:
I could see my program being misused to collect data from its users,
which could certainly be maliciously misused. As such, in responsible
use of this program, all data should be erased upon password strength
calculation, additionally, users should take care to not enter their
real personal information or passwords, more so ones that resemble them.
